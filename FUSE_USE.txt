to mount the file system:
    mkdir Directory_name
    ./filesytem Directory_name
    cd Directory_name


to add a file, you have to:
    echo Whatever you want to put into your file  >> newfile

    the mv function from dir to dir will fail.

to unmount the filesystem:
    fusermount -u Directory_name

to compile it you heres the make:
    gcc filefs.c fs.c `pkg-config fuse --cflags --libs` -o filefs
